# Wait for Vercel Preview — A GitHub Action ⏱

Do you have other Github actions (Lighthouse, Cypress, etc) that depend on the Vercel Preview URL? This action will wait until the url is available before running the next task.

Please note that this action is supposed to be run on the `pull_request` event.

## Inputs

### `token` (Required)

The github secret `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

### `environment`

Optional — The name of the environment that was deployed to (e.g., staging or production)

### `max_timeout`

Optional — The amount of time to spend waiting on Vercel. Defaults to `60` seconds

### `allow_inactive`

Optional - Use the most recent inactive deployment (previously deployed preview) associated with the pull request if
no new deployment is available. Defaults to `false`.

### `check_interval`

Optional - How often (in seconds) should we make the HTTP request checking to see if the deployment is available? Defaults to `2` seconds.

### `endpoint`

Optional - The endpoint to check

## Outputs

### `url`

The vercel deploy preview url that was deployed.
